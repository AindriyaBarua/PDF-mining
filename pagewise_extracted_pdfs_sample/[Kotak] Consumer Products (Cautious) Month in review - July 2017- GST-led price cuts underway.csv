CAUTIOUS  

AUGUST 22, 2017 

UPDATE 

BSE-30: 31,292  

Month in review – July 2017: GST-led price cuts underway. KIE consumer universe 
outperformed the broader markets over the past month delivering flattish returns versus 
negative 2% return for broader markets. RM trends were mixed – while agri-input were 
broadly deflationary, oil-based inputs inched up and several paint inputs corrected. Post 
GST, we noticed incremental activity/price changes in soaps, detergents, toothpaste, 
hair oils (led by Marico) and biscuits (more in pipeline, not yet fully visible in stores). 
Launch activity was moderate. Sector valuations remain rich at 36X FY2019E earnings 
(39X, ex-ITC). We retain our ‘tread selectively’ stance. Preferred picks – ITC, CLGT, BRIT, 
GSK-CH, BJCOR, SHK and TGBL. 

 

Pricing/promotions – GST-led price cuts in select categories 

Refer to Exhibits 2 and 3 for pricing and promotional activity respectively.  

  Soaps/detergents. We saw incremental activity in both soaps and detergents this month – 
(1) in soaps, several companies have cut prices to pass on GST benefit – HUVR has cut prices 
of Dove and Pears multipacks by 5-6% and Godrej has cut prices of Godrej No1 variants by 
11-13%; we note many other price cuts aren’t visible in the market and hence difficult to 
capture and (2) in detergents, HUVR has cut prices of its Rin and Surf Excel detergent bars 
(select SKUs) by 10-14%, cut price of Rin detergent powder by 4% and it has introduced 
fresh promotions in Surf Excel Quickwash. We also noticed high incremental activity from 
P&G in detergents both in Ariel and Tide in form of price-off and promotional volumes. 

  Personal care items. (1) Hair oils – we did notice that level of promotional intensity has 

gone down – Marico’s 20% extra on 500 ml SKU of Parachute CNO was the only 
incremental activity we noticed; no major price changes visible in hair oils except for 20% 
price hike taken by Marico in Hair & Care and (2) toothpaste – Colgate has cut prices of 
most of its toothpaste variants/SKUs by 7-11%; however, we did not notice any price 
changes yet of other players in toothpaste (more price changes still rolling out in the market 
and hence not yet fully visible). 

  Food/beverage items. (1) Biscuits – we did see incremental promotional activity from both 

Britannia and Parle in several brands and (2) edible oils – promotional offers (extra 
grammage) continue on select brands like Fortune (offering 1L free on 5L pack) and Riso 
(offering 2L free on 5L pack); Marico has also launched 1L free promotion on Saffola Gold 
and is offering price-off in Saffola Active (11% effective price cut). 

RM trends –agri-inputs mixed, oil-based inputs inflationary while paint inputs witness correction 

Refer to Exhibit 4 for detailed RM inflation impact. 

  Agri-inputs. Agri-inputs exhibited another month of mixed trends – select inputs like 

domestic tea (up 4% mom), international coffee (both variants up 3-5% mom) and sugar (up 
3% mom) witnessed inflationary trends while maize and liquid milk/milk powder were down 
4-8% mom; other key inputs like wheat and barley were flattish mom. However, we note 
inflation in several key agri-inputs such as wheat, barley and sugar has come down 
materially over past six months (wheat and barley are down 14-20% and sugar is up 
just 2% over past six months). 

  Oil commodities basket. Oil basked witnessed a broad-based inflationary trend this month 
barring LLP (down 5% mom) and PFAD (flattish mom); other inputs like crude oil (up 4% 
mom), copra (up 5% mom), rice bran oil (up 8% mom), kardi oil (up 16% mom) and mentha 
oil (up 8% mom) all inched up.

  Other commodities. Among other commodities, several paint inputs corrected after 
sustained inflation over past several months – PAN was down 22% mom, Tio2 rutile 
corrected 2% mom, styrene dropped 12% mom and VAM (domestic) fell 18% mom. 
However, VAM (China) has inched up 10% mom. 

  Who benefits? (1) Deflation in wheat and barley price will give some respite to food 
companies like Britannia, Nestle and GSK-CH, (2) deflation in liquid milk/milk powder 
prices will aid dairy companies and food companies like Britannia, Nestle and GSK-CH,  
(3) fall in LLP prices will benefit all hair oil companies and (4) correction in several paint 
inputs will benefit all paint majors. 

  Who gets impacted? (1) inflation in coffee prices will impact companies like TGBL, 

HUVR and Nestle, (2) sustained copra inflation will hurt Marico, (3) sharp jump in rice 
bran oil and kardi oil will also impact Marico, (4) higher mentha oil prices will impact 
Emami and toothpaste companies, (5) spike in crude oil will hurt all FMCG companies and 
(6) spike in VAM will impact Pidilite. 

Sector (KIE consumer universe) outperforms broader markets 

Our overall consumer coverage outperformed the broader markets delivering near-flattish 
returns over the last month versus negative 2% returns for the broader markets. Despite 
flattish return for overall consumer universe, several stocks posted handsome gains led by 
PCJ (up 44%), Titan (up 13%), BRIT (up 10%) and TGBL (up 10%). Key undperformers 
during the past month were SHK (down 9%), UNSP (down 8%), GCPL (down 8%) and 
BJCOR (down 8%). 

On a 12-month basis, sector outperformed the broader markets marginally posting 14% 
absolute return (15% ex-ITC) versus 12% return for broader markets. We retain our ‘tread 
selectively’ stance; preferred picks – ITC, CLGT, BRIT, GSK-CH, BJCOR, SHK and TGBL.

focus into its portfolio of business. It is looking to rationalize businesses to cut out the

Other newsflow 

  Patanjali Dant Kanti has outpaced Hindustan Unilever's Pepsodent, Colgate's Active Salt 
and GlaxoSmithKline's Sensodyne after nearly trebling its share in the oral care segment 
over the past year. Dant Kanti had 6.2% during the quarter ended June 2017, compared 
to 2.2% a year ago, making it the country's fourth-largest toothpaste company. Colgate 
still controlling half the market with 52.7% — lost 120 bps, while Hindustan Unilever's 
share declined 240 bps to 17.6%. Dabur, which has gained 20 bps at 12.1% along with 
Patanjali, has been fuelling its expansion of the herbal products market, underlining the 
growing demand for ayurvedic products and forcing most companies to launch herbal 
variants of toothpastes. Products that have ‘natural’ ingredients now account for nearly a 
fifth of the overall toothpaste market.  

  FMCG dealers have sought compensation from consumer companies as they are unable 
to claim credit on the past stock and therefore, have to shell out extra tax from their 
pocket for now under GST regime. This has raised their working capital costs. Trade 
partners of most consumer goods firms had destocked in the two weeks just ahead of 
the GST rollout to ensure they were not saddled with unsold or transition stocks. Those 
who did not are now facing this issue of input tax credit for this pre-GST stock. The 
problem has arisen as there is no clarity on ‘Form Tran-2’, which is to be filed by dealers 
to avail credit in lieu of tax paid on goods from pre-GST period. The GSTN does not have 
the utility needed for filing of this form. As per the GST law, Tran-2 is required to be filed 
by an assessees wanting to take deemed credit on transition stock where no duty paying 
documents are available. This is mostly for dealers who get central excise duty paid goods, 
and have paid value added tax and would now want to claim credit for the taxes paid. 
The GST rules provide that Tran-2 has to be filed by end of the tax period. Though no 
clear date has been provided in a tweet it was mentioned earlier that Tran-2 has to be 
filed by 20th of next month. But, no formal notification has been issued so far. Rules 
specify that an entity can avail transition credit after it has paid due tax on the transition 
stock. This credit is available for sales made within six months of GST cut-off and can be 
set off against GST liability on the fresh stock. Since Tran-2 facility has still not been 
activated, a dealer would need to pay entire amount in cash leading to working capital 
impact.  

  Consumer goods makers are gearing up for a drop in their high volume Army Canteen 

business, as they expect the government to impose restrictions on sales of items through 
this network of 3,900 stores to rein in alleged leakage and misuse. The Canteen Stores 
Department (CSD) is the single-largest customer of consumer goods companies in the 
country, and 5-7% of FMCG sales take place through its outlets. Stores run by the state-
owned CSD typically sell goods at prices that are 10-40% lower than in regular retail 
stores to armed services personnel, both serving and retired, and their kin. There is 
already a limit on purchases by CSD card holders but that hasn’t stopped discounted 
products being bought by some in excess of their needs. The proposal is to ration sales 
through CSD channels by anywhere between 20-40% on high-offtake products and the 
rationing will be staggered across different categories. According to some CSD card 
holders who didn’t want to be named, some stores do impose monthly limits on some 
product categories —18 bars of soap, 36 packs of biscuits or 10 kg of rice. Liquor limit is 
pegged at five to 15 bottles per month depending on the rank. For beer drinkers, one can 
get four bottles of beer for every one bottle of spirits. The plan is to raise limits 
substantially in grocery and some other product categories such as luggage said 
consumer goods industry executives. Liquor (26%) and daily consumption grocery 
products (23%) account for nearly half of CSD’s sales, while automobiles and white 
goods contribute a fifth of the total `170 bn sales in FY2017.

India 

  McDonald’s has snapped its franchise agreement with Connaught Plaza Restaurants 

(CPRL), it’s equally owned joint venture with Vikram Bakshi that operated the US chain’s 
restaurants in northern and eastern India. McDonald’s has taken away all branding, 
trademark, design and marketing policy rights from CPRL while culminating a 22-year 
relationship with Bakshi. The decision could impact about 6,500 direct jobs in India, and 
lead to the possible closure of McDonald’s restaurants in the northern and eastern 
regions, at least temporarily. CPRL owned 169 outlets, including 43 in and around Delhi 
that have already been shut down. The recent development is the latest in a long-drawn 
battle between Bakshi and McDonald’s. McDonald’s had alleged financial irregularities 
against Bakshi and removed him as the managing director of CPRL in 2013. But the 
National Company Law Tribunal reinstated him last month, terming McDonald’s action as 
“illegal, unlawful, unjust and malicious”. The battle had not only impacted profitability of 
CPRL, but also revenue growth, which fell to 6% in 2014-15 from 29% four years earlier. 
McDonald’s remains committed to finding a new partner; however, the process is at very 
early stages and it will start the process soon. It has engaged in any concrete 
conversations yet and could take several months before any partner is finalized. 
According to three industry executives (as per media reports), Amit Jatia, the vice 
chairman of Hardcastle Restaurants (HPRL) who has the master franchise for McDonald’s 
in West and South India for two decades, is the front-runner to get the rights to operate 
the US chain’s restaurants in the North and East as well.  

  Tata Global Beverages (TGBL) through its subsidiary has signed an agreement with 

Talking Rain Beverage Company, makers of Sparkling Ice flavored sparkling waters, for a 
phased launch of Himalayan in the US market. Talking Rain Beverage has a direct-store-
delivery distribution network comprising more than 300 distributors covering every 
county in the United States. Himalayan is currently available in India and Singapore. The 
brand recently launched a Sparkling variant in select markets in India and is piloting its 
flavored water ‘Orchard Pure’ in the Delhi/NCR region.  

  Marico has acquired a South African hair styling brand Isoplus for around `360 mn in an 

effort to complete its ethnic hair care portfolio in the country. The brand of styling 
products such as oil sheens and gels has annual sales of `300 mn and is the market 
leader in the styling products with about 27% share. The acquisition is through Marico's 
wholly owned step-down subsidiary and includes manufacturing facilities, working capital 
and all intellectual property rights from its original owners - JM Products and Mary L 
Harris. This bolt-on acquisition plugs a critical gap in Marico's portfolio in the ethnic hair 
care space in South Africa. At present, Marico has brands such as Caivil, Black Chic and 
Hercules in South African aftercare maintenance, chemical treatments and hair color 
segments. South Africa accounts for nearly 7% of its international business. 

  United Breweries (UBBL) is targeting to capture 25% share in imported beer market in 
India in the next 18 months by introducing global brands from the portfolio of its 
promoter Heineken NV. It has introduced in India five brands -- Sol, Edelweiss, Affligem, 
Dos Equis and Desperados -- from Heineken's stable in select cities like Delhi, Mumbai 
and Hyderabad. It also plans to sell these brands in Goa, Gurgaon, Chandigarh and Pune 
later. Imported beer is a niche market at the moment in India but is growing rapidly 
driven by affluent consumers in top metro markets. UBL has high expectation from 
Mexican brand Sol and French beer Desperados. While Edelweiss is an Austrian wheat 
beer, Affligem has roots in Belgian and Dos Equis in Mexico. The imported beers are 
shipped from Singapore but they are manufactured in the different parts of the world. 
The imported beer market is about 2 mn cases a year with Corona leading the market 
with 950,000 cases. UBL's current share in this segment is negligible. Other brands in the 
segment that are available in India include Hoegaarden, Stella Artois, Leffe and Erdinger.

  Kraft Heinz India is going to spend `1 bn over the next six months to relaunch Complan 

at a time when the malt food drink category growth rate has slipped. The company went 
for a complete brand make-over by making Complan better on the top two consumer 
drivers of the category – taste and nutrition. It is looking to grow Complan to more than 
`15 bn sales by 2020-21 from at around `7 bn now. Complan enjoys around 8% share 
of the `55 bn malted food drink market in India which is led by GSK’s Horlicks. The 
category growth rate has slipped to 3-5% but the company wants to grow upwards of 
10% in this segment. Kraft Heinz India is also studying opportunities to enter into compact 
concentrated nutrition segment with products like fortified biscuit and expand its another 
top brand Glucon-D into sachets and flavors. Glucon-D too contributes around 40% of 
revenues at around `7 bn and is the leader in the glucose segment with 65% share. 

  Mars Chocolate, the world’s largest chocolate confectionery maker, has dislodged rival 
Mondelez in market share across modern trade chains in India in the filled bar category. 
According to market researcher Nielsen's data, Mars Chocolate had 48% share on an all-
India basis in the category in 2016, moving up from 45.4% a year ago. Mars’ brands 
Snickers, Mars, Bounty and Twix have overtaken Mondelez’s 5-Star and Cadbury Fuse, 
which compete in the same filled bars category nationally across modern trade chains. 
The chocolate category in India, valued at close to `80 bn, is highly competitive with 
Mondelez, Mars, Ferrero, Nestle and Amul fighting for share across geographies and 
formats. Nationally, Mondelez leads the category with 65% share. On an all-India basis in 
the bars segment, Mondelez has more than five times the share of its nearest competitor. 
MT accounts for 10% of the overall chocolate category. 

  Tata Chemicals, Tata Global Beverages and Star Bazaar have stepped up collaboration in 
the food consumer space as multiple Tata group companies explore opportunities to 
work together as a cluster, a strategy suggested by Tata Sons' new chairman N 
Chandrasekaran. He is looking to restructure the loosely-held conglomerate into tighter 
clusters based on industries they operate in to achieve scale and cut costs. His focus is to 
create a few strong industry leaders rather than have many small companies that are 
unable to achieve scale. Tata Chemicals' consumer businesses include salt, pulses and 
water purifier, while Tata Global Beverages sells tea, coffee and packaged drinking water. 
Star Bazaar is Tata Group's hypermarket chain.  

  The Indian government has threatened Philip Morris International Inc with ""punitive 

action"" over the tobacco giant's alleged violation of the country's anti-smoking laws, 
according to a letter sent to the company by the federal health ministry. The letter was 
prompted by a Reuters investigation last month that revealed how Philip Morris was 
deploying marketing tactics in India, some targeting young people, that officials said were 
illegal. The letter cites the Reuters story in the opening paragraph, listing Philip Morris' 
marketing methods as outlined in the article, including cigarette advertisements at kiosks, 
the free distribution of Marlboro smokes at nightclubs and bars, and the use of TV 
screens to promote its cigarette brand at these events. These promotional activities are a 
violation of the country's tobacco control law and are subject to punishment under the 
act, says the letter. The health ministry also sent a letter to ITC which Reuters also 
reported last month was using some of the same promotional methods as Philip Morris, 
such as point of sale displays.  

Indian officials have repeatedly said that tobacco advertisements that use brand names, 
pack images or promotional messages are banned at kiosks - inside and outside. Philip 
Morris and ITC have said they are in compliance with tobacco control regulations and 
that the law allows advertising inside a kiosk. Since October last year, the state 
government in India's capital New Delhi has sent at least four letters to Philip Morris and 
at least three to ITC telling them to remove their advertisements at kiosks. Indian officials 
say tobacco companies get away with violations of anti-smoking regulations because law 
enforcement is weak. The health ministry also instructed state governments this month to 
move against cigarette advertising at kiosks, as well as the distribution of free cigarettes. 
The ministry requested that states submit a progress report on their actions.
