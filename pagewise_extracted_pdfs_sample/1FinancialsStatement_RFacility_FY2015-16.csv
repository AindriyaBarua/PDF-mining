Independent Auditor’s Report  

To the Members of  
 
Regenesis Facility Management Company Private Limited 
 
Report on the Financial Statements  
 
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  financial  statements  of  Regenesis  Facility  Management 
Company  Private  Limited(“the  Company”)  which  comprise  the  Balance  Sheet  as  at  March 
31, 2016, the Statement of Profit and Loss, Cash Flow Statement for the year then ended, and a 
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.  
 
Management’s Responsibility for the   Financial Statements  
 
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the 
Companies  Act,  2013  (“the  Act”)  with  respect  to  the  preparation  of  these  financial  statements 
that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of 
the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including 
the  Accounting  Standards  specified  under  Section  133  of  the  Act,  read  with  Rule  7  of  the 
Companies  (Accounts)  Rules,  2014.  This  responsibility  also  includes  maintenance  of  adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company  and  for  preventing  and  detecting  frauds  and  other  irregularities;  selection  and 
application  of  appropriate  accounting  policies;  making  judgments  and  estimates  that  are 
reasonable  and  prudent;  and  design,  implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal 
financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of 
the  accounting  records,  relevant  to  the  preparation  and  presentation  of  the  financial  statements 
that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error.  
 
Auditor’s Responsibility  
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We 
have  taken  into  account  the  provisions  of  the  Act,  the  accounting  and  auditing  standards  and 
matters which are required to be included in the audit report under the provisions of the Act and 
the Rules made thereunder.  
 
We conducted our audit in  accordance with  the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 
143(10) of the Act. Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free  from  material  misstatement.  An  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit 
evidence  about  the  amounts  and  the  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  The  procedures"
1,"selected  depend  on  the  auditor’s  judgment,  including  the  assessment  of  the  risks  of  material 
misstatement  of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error.  In  making  those  risk 
assessments,  the  auditor  considers  internal  financial  control  relevant  to  the  Company’s 
preparation  of  the  financial  statements  that  give  a  true  and  fair  view  in  order  to  design  audit 
procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an 
opinion on whether the Company has in place an adequate internal financial controls system over 
financial  reporting  and  the  operating  effectiveness  of  such  controls.  An  audit  also  includes 
evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  the  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  the 
accounting  estimates  made  by  the  Company’s  Directors,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall 
presentation of the financial statements.  
 
We believe that the audit  evidence we have obtained is  sufficient  and appropriate to  provide a 
basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements  
 
Opinion  
 
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, 
the  aforesaid  financial  statements  give  the  information  required  by  the  Act  in  the  manner  so 
required  and  give  a  true  and  fair  view  in  conformity  with  the  accounting  principles  generally 
accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2016, and its Profit and 
its Cash Flow for the year ended on that date.

5,"“Annexure  B”  to  the  Independent  Auditor’s  Report  of  even  date  on  the  Financial 
Statements of Regenesis Facility Management Company Private Limited 
 
Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 
of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)  
 
We  have  audited  the  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  of  Regenesis  Facility 
Management Company Private Limited(“the Company”) as of March 31, 2016 in conjunction 
with our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended as on 31.03.2016.  
 
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls  
 
The  Company’s  management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  internal  financial 
controls. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal  financial controls that were operating  effectively for ensuring the orderly  and  efficient 
conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, 
the  prevention  and  detection  of  frauds  and  errors,  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the 
accounting  records,  and  the  timely  preparation  of  reliable  financial  information,  as  required 
under the Companies Act, 2013.  
 
Auditors’ Responsibility  
 
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  Company's  internal  financial  controls  over 
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance 
Note  on  Audit  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  Over  Financial  Reporting  (the  “Guidance  Note”) 
and  the  Standards  on  Auditing,  issued  by  ICAI  and  deemed  to  be  prescribed  under  section 
143(10)  of  the  Companies  Act,  2013,  to  the  extent  applicable  to  an  audit  of  internal  financial 
controls,  both  applicable  to  an  audit  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  and,  both  issued  by  the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that 
we  comply  with  ethical  requirements  and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable 
assurance  about  whether  adequate  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  was 
established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.  
 
Our  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit  evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the 
internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our 
audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding 
of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based 
on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud 
or error.  
 
We believe that the audit  evidence we have obtained is  sufficient  and appropriate to  provide a 
basis  for  our  audit  opinion  on  the  Company’s  internal  financial  controls  system  over  financial 
reporting."
6,"Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting  
 
A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide 
reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of 
financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately 
and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide 
reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of 
financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations 
of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's 
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  
 
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting  
 
Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting, 
including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management  override  of  controls,  material 
misstatements  due  to  error  or  fraud  may  occur  and  not  be  detected.  Also,  projections  of  any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject 
to  the  risk  that  the  internal  financial  control  over  financial  reporting  may  become  inadequate 
because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or 
procedures may deteriorate.  
 
Opinion  
 
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls 
system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were 
operating effectively as at March 31, 2016, based on the internal control over financial reporting 
criteria  established  by  the  Company  considering  the  essential  components  of  internal  control 
stated  in  the  Guidance  Note  on  Audit  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  Over  Financial  Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

f.   PROVISIONS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS 
 

As  per  Accounting  Standard  29,  “Provisions,  Contingent  Liabilities  and  Contingent  Assets” 
(AS-29), issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the Company recognizes 
provisions  only  when  it has  a present  obligation  as  a  result  of  a past  event,  it  is  probable 
that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic  benefits  will  be  required  to  settle  the 
obligation as and when a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. 

 
  No provision is recognized for – 
 

Any possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will 
be  confirmed  only  by  the  occurrence  or  non-occurrence  of  one  or  more  uncertain 
future events not wholly within the control of the Company; or 

Any present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because – 
 

It is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits 
will be required to settle the obligation; or 
A reliable estimate of the amount of obligation cannot be made. 
 

 

Such obligations are recorded as Contingent Liabilities. These are assessed continually and 
only  that  part  of  the  obligation  for  which  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic 
benefits is probable, is provided for, except in the extremely rare circumstances where no 
reliable estimate can be made. 

Contingent  Assets  are  not  recognized  in  the  Financial  Statements  since  this  may  result  in 
the recognition of income that may never be realized. 
 

g.   RETIREMENT BENEFITS 
 

Liability is provided for retirement benefits of Provident fund & gratuity in respect of eligible 
employees by contributing to a defined contribution scheme and contributions are charged

using the Projected Unit Credit (PUC) Method 

 
 h.     IMPAIRMENT OF ASSET 
 

At each Balance Sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its fixed assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that those assets suffered impairment loss, if any 
such  indication  exists,  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  asset  is  estimated  in  order  to 
determine the extent of impairment loss. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s net 
selling  price  and  value  in  use.  In  assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows"
19,"expected from the continuing use of the asset and from its disposal are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-discount rate that reflect the current market assessment of time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The impairment loss as determined above 
is expensed off. An impairment loss recognized in prior accounting period is reversed if there 
has been change in the estimate of the recoverable amount. 

 
   i.    EARNING PER SHARE

or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.

assets can be realized in future; however, where there is unabsorbed depreciation or carried

certainty  of  realization  of  such  asset.    Deferred  tax  asset  is  reviewed  as  at  each  Balance
