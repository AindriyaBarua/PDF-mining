Information Note 

(Version 01) 

REQUEST FOR THE METH PANEL TO CONTINUE WORK ON HFC PROJECTS 

The Executive Board at its 55th meeting considered the information note prepared by the Meth Panel on 
issues referring to the use of AM0001 (the methodology for incineration of HFC23 waste streams).  The 
Board noted the concerns expressed by the Meth Panel.  To allow the Board to further consider this issue 
more information is essential.  Hence the Board requests the Meth Panel, where appropriate by using 
external expertise and by directly requesting information from the PPs of registered CDM HFC project 
activities, to provide additional information to the Board on the following issues: 

(1)  Developments of supply and demand in the global HCFC22 market, clarifying whether CDM 

HFC facilities are increasing their production and whether more HFC23 had or could have been 
generated than would have happened without the CDM. 

(2)  To enable this assessment, at least the following information shall be collected: 

(a)  For each HFC CDM project, using AM0001, the production volumes of HCFC22 since 

the year 2000 (or any later year if the installation started operating after 2000); 

(b)  An overview of the developments of supply and demand in the global HCFC22 market 
(hence covering CDM and non-CDM projects, both for emissive and for feedstock 
production of HCFC22), thereby where possible distinguishing between production in 
annex-1 and non annex-1 countries.  This overview should cover both the past since 2000 
as well as the (foreseeable) future; 

(c)  For the foreseeable future the following elements are inter alia to be taken into account 

and reported: 

(i)  Details of control provisions under Montreal Protocol on HCFC22 for emissive 

and feedstock use; 

(ii)  Anticipated impact of HCFC22 control provisions under the Montreal Protocol 

on total demand-supply situation of HCFC22; 

(iii)  Specifically, if the control provisions are likely to cause the demand for HCFC22 
to fall below the eligible capacity of CDM plants and if so, when this is likely to 
occur, if at all.  

(3)  Explain and substantiate the technological and operational possibilities and economic impact of 
influencing the ratio between HFC23 generation and the HCFC22 production (w-factor) for 
existing facilities, including swing plants, for both CDM and non-CDM HFC facilities.  Also 
explain this for new facilities.  Explain any technological developments that have led to a marked 
improvement in the w-factor in operating  plants."

(4)  The design lifetimes, the observed typical economic lifetimes and expected lifetime of operating 
HFC installations, covering both CDM and non-CDM production installations and based on 
normal operation and maintenance practices. Provide information on the number of preceding 
operational years of CDM HFC facilities at the time of their registration.  This assessment should 
also include an assessment of the impact of any possible prolonged lifetime on the generation of 
HFC23.
